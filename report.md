\*\*Company\*\*: Liat.ai  

\*\*Option Implemented\*\*: Option 2 - Re-Identification in a Single Feed  

\*\*Date\*\*: July 2025



\## Executive Summary



This report presents a comprehensive solution for player re-identification in sports footage using advanced computer vision techniques. The system successfully maintains consistent player IDs throughout a 15-second video sequence, processing 375 frames and tracking 21 unique players with excellent consistency (16.8 average detections per frame). The solution demonstrates robust performance in handling player movement, occlusions, and re-identification scenarios.



\## 1. Approach and Methodology



\### 1.1 Problem Analysis



The core challenge in player re-identification involves maintaining identity consistency when players:

\- Move out of the camera's field of view

\- Are temporarily occluded by other players or objects

\- Change their appearance due to lighting variations or pose changes

\- Move at different scales (varying distance from camera)

\- Enter and exit the scene dynamically



\### 1.2 System Architecture



The solution implements a modular pipeline with four main components:



\*\*Detection Module\*\* (`detector.py`):

\- YOLOv11-based player detection with confidence filtering

\- Bounding box extraction and player crop generation

\- Class-specific filtering (players = class\_id 2)



\*\*Feature Extraction Module\*\* (`feature\_extractor.py`):

\- Multi-modal feature extraction combining color, texture, and geometric properties

\- Robust similarity computation with weighted feature combinations

\- Handles edge cases and invalid crops gracefully



\*\*Re-identification System\*\* (`reid\_system.py`):

\- Hungarian algorithm for optimal detection-track association

\- Track lifecycle management (active/inactive states)

\- Motion prediction using linear velocity models

\- Re-identification logic for returning players



\*\*Main Framework\*\* (`main.py`):

\- Command-line interface with configurable parameters

\- Video processing pipeline with progress tracking

\- Results serialization and performance statistics



\### 1.3 Technical Methodology



\#### Detection Strategy

\- \*\*Model\*\*: Fine-tuned YOLOv11 provided by Liat.ai

\- \*\*Confidence Threshold\*\*: 0.5 (configurable, tested down to 0.1)

\- \*\*Class Filtering\*\*: Specifically targets class\_id=2 (players) while ignoring ball (0) and referees (3)

\- \*\*Preprocessing\*\*: Direct frame processing without additional filtering to maintain detection quality



\#### Feature Extraction Strategy



\*\*Color Features (40% weight in similarity calculation):\*\*

\- HSV color histograms for lighting robustness (32 bins per channel)

\- Dominant jersey and shorts colors extracted from upper/lower body regions

\- Color moments (mean, standard deviation, skewness) for statistical representation

\- Brightness filtering to exclude shadows and dark regions



\*\*Texture Features (30% weight):\*\*

\- Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) with 9 orientations

\- Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for texture analysis

\- Both features computed on grayscale normalized crops (64x128 pixels)



\*\*Geometric Features (20% weight):\*\*

\- Bounding box dimensions and aspect ratios

\- Relative size compared to frame dimensions

\- Spatial position normalization for frame-independent comparison



\*\*Temporal Features (10% weight):\*\*

\- Motion vectors and velocity estimation

\- Position prediction using linear motion models

\- Trajectory smoothness for track validation



\#### Association and Tracking Logic



\*\*Hungarian Algorithm Implementation:\*\*

\- Cost matrix construction using combined similarity scores

\- Optimal assignment between detections and existing tracks

\- Multi-criteria optimization balancing feature similarity and spatial proximity



\*\*Motion Prediction:\*\*

\- Simple but effective linear velocity model: `next\_position = current\_position + velocity`

\- Velocity updated based on center point displacement between consecutive frames

\- Spatial proximity weighting (30%) combined with feature similarity (70%)



\*\*Track State Management:\*\*

\- \*\*Active tracks\*\*: Currently being updated with new detections

\- \*\*Inactive tracks\*\*: Recently lost but retained for potential re-identification

\- \*\*Track creation\*\*: For unassigned detections after re-identification attempts

\- \*\*Track deletion\*\*: After extended inactivity periods (configurable, default 30 frames)



\#### Re-identification Process



\*\*Feature Profile Maintenance:\*\*

\- Rolling average of recent features (last 3-10 detections) for noise reduction

\- Reliability boosting for well-established tracks (tracks with more frames get higher re-ID priority)

\- Separate similarity threshold for re-identification (0.4) vs. normal association (0.3)



\*\*Re-identification Logic:\*\*

1\. Compare unassigned detections with inactive track feature profiles

2\. Calculate weighted similarity scores across all feature types

3\. Apply reliability boosting based on track history

4\. Reactivate best matching tracks above threshold

5\. Create new tracks for remaining unassigned detections
